# WhatsappBackupReader
A simple tool that converts exported WhatsApp discussions to readable html file

If you want to backup an important discussion from WhatsApp to your computer you can easily convert it to an html page and store it.

Please note that Whatsapp doesn't allow you to export very big discussions, it has limits (See table below)

You can use it from [HERE](http://jspractice666.000webhostapp.com/)

You can also check this [DEMONSTRATION VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFvHOYVUHk) on Youtube.

Please note that this application is set to work with exports in English by default. That means that if the messages in your export are marked with timestamps in a different time format and the presence of files is marked by something different than "file attached", you need to edit two constants on the first few lines in the `app.js` file.

Hope you like it!
